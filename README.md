# Human_Activity_Recognition_Using_smartphone
Using Boosting algorithm

The dataset is one of the UCI datasets.
I am going to solve Human Activity Recognition based on the sensory data. The task
is to predict six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) based on signals
extracted by wearing a smartphone on the waist.
The dataset is a combination of several signals extracted from an accelerometer and
gyroscope when with different human activities. The goal of this question is to create a
model (you are free to use any machine learning model) to be able to predict the human
activity based on the input signals.
